# Correlation Method

* The folder **Cor_code** contains the code for the correlation method.
* The folder **Dataset** within Cor_code should contain the datasets from UNSW-NB15, ToN_IoT and BoT-IoT.
### The datasets should have these names:
  #### BoT-IoT
  - IoT_Botnet_Test
  - IoT_Botnet_Train
  #### TON_IoT  
  - TON_train_test
  #### UNSW-NB15
  - UNSW-NB15_Train
  - UNSW-NB15_Test

The folder **Used** within the Dataset folder is where the preprocessed csv files will be stored.
